# ARDUINO_integertime_seconds
Unsigned long (pulled from Arduino site): variables are extended size variables for number storage, and store 32 bits (4 bytes). Unlike standard longs unsigned longs wonâ€™t store negative numbers, making their range from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (2^32 - 1).

% (modular division): Gives the remainder when dividing two numbers. ex: 10%7 = 3

floor (floor division): Does the opposite of modular division and gives the number of times the numerator divides into the denominator. The remaind will not be included. ex: 10//7 = 1

Serial.println(value): prints the value to the Serial monitor
