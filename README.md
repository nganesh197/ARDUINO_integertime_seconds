#Arduino Base Code 

>I created this minirepository so that it is easier for myself to find code to insert into another set of code. To be completely honest, there is not anything unique about this. I just dislike searching for code repeatedly on my desktop or online. If you find it useful, by all means, make a pull request of the code that helps you out! 

ARDUINO_integertime_seconds
>Unsigned long (pulled from Arduino site): variables are extended size variables for number storage, and store 32 bits (4 bytes). Unlike standard longs unsigned longs wonâ€™t store negative numbers, making their range from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (2^32 - 1).
>% (modular division): Gives the remainder when dividing two numbers. ex: 10%7 = 3
>floor (floor division): Does the opposite of modular division and gives the number of times the numerator divides into the denominator. The remaind will not be included. ex: 10//7 = 1
>Serial.println(value): prints the value to the Serial monitor
